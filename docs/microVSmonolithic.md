#### microservice architecture and a non-microservice (monolithic) architecture

**Non-Microservice (Monolithic) Architecture:**

In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, indivisible unit. It is a self-contained, tightly-coupled system where all components are interconnected and interdependent. For example, consider a traditional e-commerce application that includes components for user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, and payment processing, all bundled together as a single application.

```
+-----------------------------------------------+
|                                               |
|              E-Commerce Application           |
|                                               |
|  +---------------+  +---------------+  +-----+|
|  | Authentication|  | Product Catalog|  |Cart||
|  +---------------+  +---------------+  +-----+|
|                                               |
|  +---------------+  +---------------+  +-----+|
|  | Order Processing| |Payment Processing| |   ||
|  +---------------+  +---------------+  +-----+|
|                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------+
```

**Microservice Architecture:**

In a microservice architecture, the application is decomposed into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability or domain. These services are loosely coupled, communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. For example, the same e-commerce application could be broken down into separate microservices for user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, and payment processing.

```
+-----------------------------------------------+
|                                               |
|              E-Commerce Application           |
|                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------+
                   |               |
            +------+------+  +------+------+
            |              |  |              |
+------------+------------+  +------------+------------+
|                         |  |                         |
|    Authentication       |  |     Product Catalog     |
|        Service          |  |         Service         |
|                         |  |                         |
+-------------------------+  +-------------------------+
                                        |
                             +----------+----------+
                             |                      |
                   +----------+----------+  +-------+-------+
                   |                      |  |                |
            +------+------+      +--------+--------+  +-------+-------+
            |              |      |                 |  |                |
            | Shopping Cart|      |Order Processing |  | Payment Processing|
            |   Service    |      |     Service     |  |     Service    |
            |              |      |                 |  |                |
            +---------------+      +-----------------+  +----------------+
```

In this example, each service is responsible for a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs (represented by the arrows).

The microservice architecture promotes modularity, scalability, and resilience, as individual services can be updated, replaced, or scaled without affecting the entire application. However, it also introduces additional complexity in terms of service communication, data management, and overall system management.
